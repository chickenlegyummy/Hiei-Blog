"en": "So I have been working on a multiplayer game using JavaScript, which is originally just a simple shooting game I made for fun. However, I decided to add multiplayer functionality to it, which turned out to be quite a challenge. I got ideas from working on a course project before in PolyU, COMP2432 - Operating System. The project do I/O between parent and children processes, which is quite similar to how multiplayer games work.\n\n I used Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO for real-time communication between clients. The architecture is quite simple, with a server listening for connections and operations by the players. Which handles the game state and broadcasts updates to all connected clients. <div class=\"code\"> // Broadcast new target to all clients (in server.js)\nio.emit('targetSpawned', target.toNetworkData()); </div> \n\n For example, when a player moves or shoots, it creates a message that is sent to the server, which then updates the game state and sends the updated state in a message to all clients. All the notified clients then rendering the game state, like player positions and actions, targets, and bullets.\n\n<img width=\"70%\" src=\"public/server.webp\"/>\n\n Although the structure is simple, the most challenging part is to ensure that all the I/O communication is done in real-time and synchronized across all clients. There is a crucial part that rendering objects in client-side, sometimes I got duplicated remote players or false positions. To fix them, I had to rewrite the rendering logic than the original SinglePlayer version of the game. Most importantly is to do research online about how others managed to do it.\n\n Here is the github repo link <a style=\"color: var(--text-primary)\" href=\"https://github.com/chickenlegyummy/oiia-threeJS\">Click Me!</a>",

The blogs here are not meant to be serious and to be 'public' in any way. They are just my personal notes and thoughts, so please don't take them too seriously. I will try to write in both English and Chinese, because I made the functionality to support both languages, why not use it? Well that's it for now. See'ya",

"zh_hk": "我想講我文筆唔係幾好，所以中文呢邊我會寫得口語啲，應該係話全程都係用白話。咁基於呢一點呢，我就真係個腦諗到寫咩就寫咩，exactly好似正常講野咁，所以中文呢邊我會解釋清楚啲同expand多少少啦。Well，入正題，呢個係我第一次寫blog，或者話第一次嘗試寫blog。其實呢個blog係我為咗好玩 (返工摸魚)，同埋順便寫下啲template/component比我到時用，例如話個tag searcher同light-dark theme呢啲。咁我都寫左個page出黎就順便記錄下我學web dev同埋programming嘅進度。咁呢個blog上面既野係0認真既，亦都唔係要突登公開既，咁你入得黎呢度一係我叫你入黎 or 真係一個冇野做既廢人 or 起底既仆街。BTW 我會試下用英文同中文寫呢個blog (我應該會寫左一邊先再AI translate呢一邊 unless我真係好得閒)，咁我都已經做咗個function，咁點解唔用呢？講完，88你條尾。"
